# NFTs Development
- Launch the NFTs marketplace (artwork, gaming cards, digital collectibles or real-world assets)
- NFT marketplace design and development: ERC-721, ERC-1155 standards, smart contracts and IPFS protocols.
- Test smart contracts on NFT platform and ensure that contracts are free breaches and bugs.
- A token creation features: users can mint tokens for their virtual or real-world assets.

## NFT Use Cases
- Cryto Collectibles: unique digital assets such as rare baseball cards or a rare whisky bought and sold on the blockchain. NFTs verify and record the ownership of crypto collectibles.
- Gaming: Transfer the game assets like a rare skin or avatar and provide proof of authenticity.

## Features of NFTs
- Tradability: It allows NFT token holders to leverage the benefits of trading capabilities, bunding, bidding and the ability to sell NFTs in markets.
- Scarcity: using smart contracts to place huge capital on the supply of NFTs and enforce properties that cannot be changged after the tokens'issuance.
- Indivisible: can only pay for a whole item or buy nothing at all. NFTs don't provide divisibility and stay unique at all times.
- Standardization: reusable, common and inheritable standards for all non-fungible tokens. It enables standardization of collectibles represented in NFTs to exhibit in the marketplace.

## Developement Roadmap
- Project ideas: product requirements -> Consultation: share project proposal with budget and timeline estimates -> Project Kickoff -> Development (Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate, Production) -> Deployment (Provisioning, Deploy on Main Network) -> Upgrades

## Blockchain Development Platforms
- Hyperledger: to advance cross-industry collaboration by offering the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools.
- Ethereum: decentralized computing platform that uses ETH to pay transaction fees.
- Stellar: decentralized protocol for digital currency to fiat money low-cost transfers.
- Corda: an open source blockchain platform for bunsinesses.
- EOS: a blockchain protocol based on the cryptocurrency EOS. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.
- Tron: a blockchain-based decentralized platform that aims to build a free, global digital content entertainment system with distributed storage technology, and allows easy and cost-effective sharing of digital content.
- Hedera Hashgraph: public decentralized distributed ledger that utilizes the fast, fair, and secure hashgraph consensus mechanism.
- Tezos: decentralized, open-source blockchain network that can execute peer-to-peer transactions and serve as a platform for deploying smart contracts.
