# NFTs Development
- Launch the NFTs marketplace (artwork, gaming cards, digital collectibles or real-world assets)
- NFT marketplace design and development: ERC-721, ERC-1155 standards, smart contracts and IPFS protocols.
- Test smart contracts on NFT platform and ensure that contracts are free breaches and bugs.
- A token creation features: users can mint tokens for their virtual or real-world assets.

## NFT Use Cases
- Cryto Collectibles: unique digital assets such as rare baseball cards or a rare whisky bought and sold on the blockchain. NFTs verify and record the ownership of crypto collectibles.
- Gaming: Transfer the game assets like a rare skin or avatar and provide proof of authenticity.

## Features of NFTs
- Tradability: It allows NFT token holders to leverage the benefits of trading capabilities, bunding, bidding and the ability to sell NFTs in markets.
- Scarcity: using smart contracts to place huge capital on the supply of NFTs and enforce properties that cannot be changged after the tokens'issuance.
- Indivisible: can only pay for a whole item or buy nothing at all. NFTs don't provide divisibility and stay unique at all times.
- Standardization: reusable, common and inheritable standards for all non-fungible tokens. It enables standardization of collectibles represented in NFTs to exhibit in the marketplace.

## Developement Roadmap
- Project ideas: product requirements -> Consultation: share project proposal with budget and timeline estimates -> Project Kickoff -> Development (Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate, Production) -> Deployment (Provisioning, Deploy on Main Network) -> Upgrades

## Blockchain Development Platforms
- Hyperledger: to advance cross-industry collaboration by offering the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools.
- Ethereum: decentralized computing platform that uses ETH to pay transaction fees.
- Stellar: decentralized protocol for digital currency to fiat money low-cost transfers.
- Corda: an open source blockchain platform for bunsinesses.
- EOS: a blockchain protocol based on the cryptocurrency EOS. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.
- Tron: a blockchain-based decentralized platform that aims to build a free, global digital content entertainment system with distributed storage technology, and allows easy and cost-effective sharing of digital content.
- Hedera Hashgraph: public decentralized distributed ledger that utilizes the fast, fair, and secure hashgraph consensus mechanism.
- Tezos: decentralized, open-source blockchain network that can execute peer-to-peer transactions and serve as a platform for deploying smart contracts.

## NFT Marketplaces
- Decentralized platform that allows users to create, buy, sell and store non-fungible tokens.
- NFT marketplace platforms: Rarible, Sorare and OpenSea

### Workflow
- Users sign up (platform) and install a digital wallet to store NFTs.
- Users can create their assets by uploading items to exhibit their work.
- Users can select which payment tokens they would like to accept for their art and set a fee.
- List the items for sale (bid for an auction or fixed price).
- Users can choose a bid for a fixed price or an auction. A transaction is created when listing an item for sale to launch a personal trading smart contract for the user wallet.
- New NFTs are approved -> potential buyers can see it in the list for sales.
- The tokens's owner start accepting bids
- When the auction closes, sellers are notified about top bids.
- The NFT platform regulates the transfer of digital assets and funds.

### Features
- Storefront: offers users all the information required for an item: bids, owners, preview or price history.
- Creation: users able to upload the file and enter the required token information (name, price, description, and tags). The collectible verification process: can check the stage of the verification process for their items.
- Filters: users can select items by payment method, price, most viewers, listing status, category and collection.
- Search: tagging and category management to allow users to search collectibles (search bar on the site)
- Buy and Bid:
    - Users can buy and bid for NFTs listed on the platform.
    - The bidding feature should include a bid expiration date and allow users to view details about the bid's current status.
- Rating: user can rate best sellers and prove their reliability (based on successful deals, amount of added valuable tokens).
- Wallet: users to store, send and receive non-fungible tokens. Wallet should integrated with the most popular wallets like coinbase, binance, formatic or MyEtherWallet.

__Bonus__: create community forum, push notification system (inform users about new collectibles or current status of their listings), real-time messenger (seller and buyers can discuss tokens)

__Developement__: UX/UI Developement, Authorization and Security, User Profiles, Home Page, Search and Filters, Product Page, Reviews and Ratings, Shopping Cart, Payments, Notifications, Blockchain (Ethereum) Integration, NFT Management, Inventory Management, Buyer Panel, Author Panel, Admin Panel.
### Technology Stack
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polkadot, Flow, Tezos, Cardano, Cosmos, WAX.
- Storage Platform:
    - IPFS: peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to store media content in a decentrailzed way. The media file related to NFTs cannot be stored directly on the blockchain.
    - Filecoin: decentralized storage network designed specifically to store the most critical information.
    - Pinata: platforms to upload and manage files on IPFS. It provides secure and verifiable files for NFTs.
- NFT Standards: ERC-721, ERC-1155, FA2, dGoods, TRC-721, BEP-20

__Example__:
- Setup Environment (Tools) -> Writing Smart Contracts -> Minting NFTs -> Display NFT Collectibles (Front-end) -> Fetching NFTs from Blockchain -> Get Media from IPFS -> Transfer NFTs -> Deploy and Mint Tokens -> Deploy the Marketplace Contract.
